  "animals.description.two":
    "Each chicken has an indicator above its head, displaying its current mood or needs. This can range from being hungry, tired, happy, or ready to hatch. To keep your chickens content and productive, feed them by selecting wheat from your inventory and interacting with the chicken. Feeding initiates the egg timer, which takes 48 hours for the eggs to be ready to hatch. Once the eggs are ready, visit your farm, check the icon above each chicken, and interact with them to find out the type of egg that has hatched. Occasionally, you may even discover rare mutant chickens, which offer special boosts such as faster egg production, increased yield, or reduced food consumption.",

  "scavenger.description.two":
    "Another form of scavenging involves gathering wild mushrooms that appear spontaneously on your farm and surrounding islands. These mushrooms can be collected for free and used in recipes, quests, and crafting items. Keep an eye out for these mushrooms, as they replenish every 16 hours, with a maximum limit of 5 mushrooms on your farm.

Additionally, seasonal tickets add a strategic element to the game, as players must decide how to allocate their tickets wisely, whether it's collecting rare items, opting for higher supply decorations, or exchanging tickets for SFL. The seasonal mechanic keeps the game engaging and ensures that there's always something to look forward to in Sunflower Land.",
  "seasons.description.two":
    "The availability of seasonal items at the Goblin Blacksmith adds another layer of excitement. Players must gather the required resources and seasonal tickets to craft these limited-supply items, creating a sense of competition and urgency. Planning ahead and strategizing become crucial as players aim to secure their desired items before the supply runs out. Moreover, the option to swap seasonal tickets for SFL provides flexibility and allows players to make choices that align with their specific gameplay goals.
